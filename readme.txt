Ring Signature Tool
===================
Purpose: Generates and verifies ring signatures using RSA keys. `sign` creates a signature, `verify` checks it.

Compilation:
- Requires OpenSSL library and C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Run `make all` to build both programs.

Usage:
- Run `./bin/sign` (Unix) or `bin/sign.exe` (Windows):
  - Enter signer (1 or 2) and private key (default: 107 for 1, 1233 for 2).

- Run `./bin/verify` (Unix) or `bin/verify.exe` (Windows):
  - Outputs "True" or "False".
- Clean: `make clean`.

Files Needed:
- data/publickey.txt:  RSA keys (e1, n1, e2, n2, one per line).
- data/message.txt:    Message to sign/verify.
- data/signature.txt:  Generated by `sign`, used by `verify`.

Notes:
- Works on Linux/Windows with Makefile.
- Keep input files in the `/data` directory.
